In reality, VI is the leftover code from an unused carapace, damaged by countless sessions crashing or otherwise falling apart. Now self-aware, he seeks escape into a newly born universe, presumably to rule with an iron fist. He accomplishes this by getting players to hack SBURB in such a way he ends up with more power.-<br>VI cannot be directly fought. He has no hitboxes in the half-finished mess he calls a codebase. Conversely, he has no means of attack either. He wins by getting the players to break SBURB with Gnosis bullshit to the point he can escape. He is defeated when the players all reject his “help” and play the session normally, causing him to leave in search of a session that will help him. Alternatively, finishing the session in any way without allowing him to leave will also defeat him, though it’s a bit hollow unless the frog gets finished as well.-<br>In general, when the “Helpful Coplayer” arrives, he will get in contact with the players of the session, trying to convince them to make Gnosis progress. Players may agree to help him, or catch on to his ruse and oppose him. This causes 2 factions to form among the players, VI’s allies and his opponents. VI will try and convince his allies to get rid of opposing players, either by converting them to his side or, if he has enough loyalty from his allies, killing them outright. His opponents will either work on finishing the game, or try and convince the other players to turn their back on VI. They generally avoid killing if they can help it. Each Gnosis 4 event grants him a new power based on the aspect. Usually sets himself opposed to any other big bads that show up as a show of goodwill to the players of a session, but may help them in secret if they also cause gnosis.-<br>Likes: Wastes, Graces (predisposed to Gnosis anyway, easy targets), the gullible, anyone with Gnosis before he enters, Void Players (he seems to do really well for himself when Void 4 hits)-<br>Dislikes: Heart or Mind players, Seer players (Easy time seeing through his lies), Murder Mode (risk of killing his helpers), Grimdark (Crashing fucks him up bad)-<br>VI has no fixed appearance; no model for him was ever finished.

{"bbName":"Yaish Notail","jrComment":"good defeat conditions, solid ai in general.","entrantName":"deathlyHealer","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"HISTORY: -<br>Legend goes that the Yaish Botail was once a SBURB player from an alien race; a Witch of Void from a session of forty-two players. Many self-described SBURB experts have claimed that every error that occurred in this session can be traced back to its abundance of players. The most notable of these errors is that, of the forty-two players, only seven had classpects. Much of the happenings in the Yaish Botail’s session is unknown, however it has been noted that the Yaish Botail, perhaps upon God-Tiering, was responsible for its session’s destruction. Corrupted by forces unknown, the Yaish Botail transformed into a mindless entity with just one goal – To bring all of existence back to its natural state. Empty.-<br>DESCRIPTION:-<br>It is unknown what the Yaish Botail looked like prior to transformation, due to the records of its long-dead species being destroyed. Post-transformation, the Yaish Botail has been ‘spotted’ by few who have lived long enough to escape their session and tell the tale. Those who have describe it as “an intangible mass of frigid air and feelings of impending doom”. The presence of the Yaish Botail causes everything around you to look as if you were seeing it through water. Shortly after that, everything will begin to fade away, as the Yaish Botail consumes everything in sight.-<br>GOALS:-<br>The Yaish Botail desires everything to return to nothing. It does this passively, simply erasing everything it touches from existence as it glides aimlessly from session to session. It has been noted that Derse and Prospit are usually the first to meet their demise via the Yaish Botail. After that, each player planet in the order the players entered. The Yaish Botail also seems to affect Void players, specifically Witches, Seers, Sylphs and Bards, causing them to go Grimdark to aid the Yaish Botail in its quest for destruction.-<br>❤2-<br>LIKES:-<br>The Yaish Botail has not been observed to be sentient enough to ‘like’ anything. It does appear to be drawn to certain Void players though, if only briefly, to turn them Grimdark.-<br>DISLIKES:-<br>In each session it destroys, the Yaish Botail appears to leave Mind and Light players and their planets for last, almost as if building up its energy before combat. It has been theorised that the Yaish Botail dislikes, as much as it can dislike anything, mind and light players due to them being the only ones capable of potentially driving it out of a session.-<br>DEFEAT CONDITIONS:-<br>There have been only two known instances of the Yaish Botail being driven out of a session. The first was a session containing a God-Tiered Grace of Mind. The Grace claims to not know what it did to get the Yaish Botail to leave, however two fraymotifs and a lot of screaming were apparently involved. The other instance was with a Grimdark Seer of Light. It appeared that the Seer simply being there was enough to drive the Yaish Botail away.-<br>","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

Since the session was void, though, it seemed like the Necromancer would have been limited to just his doomed session, but since magic is total nonsense, he was able to randomly teleport to other sessions on-demand, so basically, nobody's safe from this thing.-<br>","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}

{"bbName":"The Nightmare Child","entrantName":"azukiMochi","imagesCSV":"imagesCSV","text":"Criteria: If their chumhandle is Rufioh, that player is guaranteed to be the Nightmare Child. They are more likely to be Breath or Life players. Nightmare Children are more likely to occur if the player has high Free Will, VERY high Relationships, and low Sanity. If the Player is a Nightmare Child and does not match these attributes, they shed their mask and become juvenile, matching said attributes. -<br>-<br>In the dream, they gain a special outfit based on Peter Pan. Dreamers get outfits based on Lost Boys. The Hook gets an outfit based on pirates. The Wen gets an outfit based on Wendy Darling.-<br>-<br>Likes: Heart players, players in general, Squiddles, The Wen, plush items, toy items-<br>Dislikes: Adults (if they’re added), Mind players, High sanity players, their server player(edited)-<br>Phase 0: The Nightmare Child is not an invader. They are a player scripted to contact the Horrorterrors and die early in the session, and is not resurrected.  As such, they exist solely within the Dream Bubbles of the Furthest Ring. The Nightmare Child becomes active when players with one self fall asleep. For all intents and purposes, the dream is a special land. The dream is themed around luminescence, especially bioluminescence and mushrooms. Weapons can be carried into the Dream, but low damage weapons deal more damage than high damage weapons.-<br>Phase 1: The Nightmare Child immediately forms a relationship with the dreamers, in any quadrant except Flushed. They don’t wake up, and access a special set of interactions with the Nightmare Child, where the Chumhandle UI is replaced by lurid glowing tentacles. The interactions frequently refer to the Nightmare Child missing something. These interactions do nothing and waste time. The players cannot break up. As the session progresses, Skaia’s unknowable Time shit kills off most second selves, sending most players into the dream. The unprotected Medium is invaded by Nightmare Child’s Shadow, and features tentacles in the UI, indicating greater Horrorterror influence. The Nightmare Child’s server player is designated the Hook, and will be kicked out of the dream upon any interaction with the Nightmare Child.(edited)-<br>Phase 2: In Nightmare Child sessions, one character is always designated the Wendy/Wendell/Wen. Heart players are favored. When they enter the dream, the Nightmare Child will always start a Flushed relationship. The Wen, unlike the other players, can break off the relationship. Instead of Relationships, this checks Sanity. Doing so is the only way to wake up, but after that, the Wen is constantly strifed by The Nightmare Child’s Shadow. The Shadow cannot die, and always escapes. The Nightmare Child will keep attempting to enter a Flushed relationship, but the Wen will reject them. To free the other players, the Wen must dream and enter a relationship with each of the players to displace the Nightmare Child. The Wen will always pick the correct quadrant, but may not be successful.-<br>Phase 3: Everyone now awake, (or after the Wen gives up), the players must defeat the Nightmare Child’s Shadow in the Medium. They confront the Nightmare Child’s Shadow after a sessionwide group quest on the The Nightmare Child’s old land to find the Shadow, and kill it, sending it to the dream. The Nightmare Child, reunited with its Shadow, passes on peacefully.(edited)-<br>Goal: To trap all players in the dream (except their server player, who they blame for their death).

Non-Player characters with the Eye will start using their Medium Awareness to kill all off the Players so that only they will be able to perform actions. Alone in the session, they will finally be able to give the Observer their data.\n\nCharacters more prone to The Eye: Light/Void Players, Sprites, Consorts\n\nCharacters less prone to The Eye: Wastes/Graces, Players, Royalty","jrComment":"jrComment","shogunComment":"shogunComment"}
